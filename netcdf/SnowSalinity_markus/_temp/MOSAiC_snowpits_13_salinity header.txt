Abstract:	In the designated snowpits, 100cm3 of snow was collected in the field, melted and measured for salinity in the laboratory on board Polarstern. Salinity of the melted snow samples was measured using the YSI 30 Salinity, Conductivity and Temperature sensor. The transport containers, as well as the YSI tip, were cleaned using milli-Q water. Salinity profiles were measured at the same intervals as density and stable isotope profiles.
